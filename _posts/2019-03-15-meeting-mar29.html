---[ Ghidra: reviewing the new player in the RE scene, by <a href="https://twitter.com/Blazef104">Blazef104</a>

In the past few months the hype grew around the announcement of a novel open source tool for Reverse Engineering (RE) named Ghidra and developed by NSA which was set to be released in March 2019.
Now that Ghidra hit the web it is time to get our hands dirty and see if it can keep up with all the promises, finally providing a great (free) alternative to IDA pro. 
In the talk we will go through the main features of the program, explore its best selling points and compare it with its main competitor. We will also see a quick demo on a simple executable to show a possible real life scenario.

An introduction to fuzzers showing strengths and weakness of this approach in automatic bug detection. In particular we will dive into the usage and the internals of one of the most popular fuzzers of this time: American Fuzzy Lop. We will learn not only how to use it but also some useful strategies that can be applied to specified classes of programs to improve the performance of AFL.
