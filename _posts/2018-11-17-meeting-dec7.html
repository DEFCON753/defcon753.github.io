---[ Side channels attacks in air-gapped environments, by <a href="https://twitter.com/josuke_miyazawa">josuke_miyazawa</a>

In this talk we give an overview of the techniques that are used in order to exfiltrate information from systems without an internet connection. We then see more in detail the case in which the target doesn't even have speakers, and in the end we quickly see even more advanced techniques for the most curious ones.
