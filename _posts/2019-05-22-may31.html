---[ Transient Execution Attacks: Episode II - Attack of the Zombies, by <a href="https://twitter.com/borrello_pietro">anticlockwise</a>

We will continue our journey into the never ending story of Transient Execution Attacks, to understand how modern processor microcomponents may still lead to arbitrary secret leakage.
Meltdown and Spectre were only the beginning, Microarchitectural Data Sampling attacks are able to leak data across any protection boundary.
We will understand why data may be not securely kept in any privilege boundary, and how may be impossible to enforce process, kernel or even virtual machines isolation in a SMT environment.
