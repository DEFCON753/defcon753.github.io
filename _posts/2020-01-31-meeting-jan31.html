---[ Breaking the walls: CPU introspection through micro-architectural data sampling, by <a href="https://twitter.com/borrello_pietro">pietroborrello</a>

While the x86 instruction set architecture strictly defines the observable behavior of modern CPU, its inner workings remains highly undocumented. The micro-operations that govern the processor are hidden behind a wall. 
Let's break this wall using vulnerabilities of the CPU itself, to build a sniffer that precisely observes the micro-architectural activity.
Have you ever wanted to see how does a Spectre attack looks like from *inside* the CPU? Come and see, we don't like walls!
This talk is based on the recent work of <a href="https://gamozolabs.github.io/metrology/2019/12/30/load-port-monitor.html">Brandon Falk</a>.
