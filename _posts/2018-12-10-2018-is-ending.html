Hi, fellow hackers or aspirant hackers,
the last meeting of this year of this DEF CON group was done some days ago.
Time has passed quickly but as many as four meetings have been held from September and a report with some considerations and proposal needs to be drawn up.

Firstly, you can find all the stuff related to the meetings of this year <a href="https://github.com/DefconRome/meetings-2018">here</a>.
Read the slides again. These talks were great!
A group is strong when proposing original contents (2/8 talks were about new tools, RopGun and BluePill!) and interesting contents that can inspire new works and knowledge.
I can say for sure that we are this kind of group and I expect even better talks in 2019.

Regards 2019, as you surely have noted 4/8 talks of 2018 were about binary analysis and this talks were made by some people of our team of organizers.
Yeah binary analysis is cool and we love too much this matter but I would like also to see some talks about other fields of computer security.
I encourage any people of the group that is good (or maybe want to be good and this is an excuse to start studying, feel free to ping us for pointers) in a matter that is not binary analysis, for instance, web security, to propose initiatives.
As I repeat in every meeting this is a group, not a lesson, we exchange knowledge and grow together.

But what is the real novelty for 2019?
A ghost page is in this website, never used, never touched. The <a href="https://defcon11396.it/projects/">Projects</a> page.
In 2019 we can (must) use this page. Anyone can propose a group project, for example coding an implementation of somewhat seen in a talk, and anyone can agree to participate in the development under the auspices of the DEF CON group.
We expect great proposals and we can extend the duration of the meeting if people want to stay before or after the talks to work on some projects.

Happy new year from the entire staff, see you in January.
