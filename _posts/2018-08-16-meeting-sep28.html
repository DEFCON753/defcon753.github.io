---[ Tales of cheap duckies: combining Digispark Attiny85, TOR and the Empire Framework, by <a href="https://twitter.com/W1ckDavid">W1ckDavid</a>

Programmable MCUs (acronym for Micro Controller Units) have limitless possibilities.
These boards can be programmed to emulate USB devices and automatically mimic human interaction: the so called ‘rubber duckies’ are the swiss-knife for all ethical hackers, PenTesters and cyber security enthusiasts into Physical Hacking. 
The potential of such devices will be the core of this talk. 
Starting from a real story of programming, testing and curiosity, the true power of rubber duckies will be unlocked in a practical study case. This scenario, presented in a live demo, will show how to code, deploy and execute anonymous reverse shells through the use of Digispark Attiny85, TOR and the Empire Framework.
