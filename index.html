---[ About

We are a <a href="https://defcongroups.org/dcpages-int.html">DEF CON group</a> located in Rome, Italy.
Our meetings are every last friday of the month at 5 p.m.
The <a href="https://www.dis.uniroma1.it/en/node/6422/how-reach-us">location</a> is the Department of Computer, Control, and Management Engineering (DIAG) Antonio Ruberti at Sapienza University of Rome

Our usual schedule is two talks of 30 minutes for meeting.
After the talks, anyone can present a personal project to the community and/or propose a talk for the next meeting (just ask the organizers to get the microphone).
In the end there is the community networking, don't be afraid and get in touch with other people like you!

---[ Call for speakers

Mail us if you want to propose a talk!
We accept first time speakers and this can be an opportunity to practice a talk.

All slides must be in English and the talk itself can be in English or Italian.
The priority is given to security related topics but we can also accept talks with topics like governance, open source, harware design, robotics etc...

Special events (like a 2 hours hands-on about an advanced security topic) can be discussed with us.
